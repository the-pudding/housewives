For the uninitiated, Mary Cosby and Jen Shah are cast members on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. From the first episode, it’s clear they don’t see eye to eye. Why? One unforgettable comment: Mary said Jen “smelled like hospital.”","visual":"Clip - Mary describing the incident to Whitney"},{"text":"What happened was: Jen had just come from the hospital where she was visiting her aunt who had to get both legs amputated. When Mary saw Jen, she said that Jen “smelled like hospital”, which hurt Jen’s feelings. (Watch below to hear the whole story from them.)","visual":"Clip of the story from their perspective. Longer clip, optional to play"},{"text":"Fast forward a bit, and the two are at a party together. Jen is still holding onto the comment and wants an apology from Mary.","visual":"Clip - ?"},{"text":"Apologies can be tricky. I hate it when anyone is upset with me, and someone coming up to me at a party wanting to tell me how I’ve hurt them is a nightmare."},{"text":"Let’s see how Mary handles it.","visual":"3-4 little clips of silly things Mary says"},{"text":"In the world of reality television, apologies are a central theme. People are constantly wronging each other, confronting each other, demanding apologies, and - more often than not - sidestepping them. We can tell the apologies don’t work because the same issues resurface in the next episode, the next confrontation, the next fight.","visual":"Clip - “I appreciate the apology, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that we still have issues.”"},{"text":"To understand just how bad these apologies are, I went through every episode and documented the apology moments.","visual":"Viz - timeline with apology moments labeled"},{"text":"These are all the moments when an apology was being attempted or demanded. Almost every episode has at least one.","visual":"Viz - timeline with apology moments labeled"},{"text":"And here’s how often it was actually a decent apology as opposed to one like Mary’s. X% of the apologies are flagrantly bad.","visual":"Viz - timeline with apology moments labeled, color coded by good/bad"},{"text":"I wanted to understand what exactly made many of these apologies so ineffective. And after watching over 70 episodes of the show, crunching the numbers, and discussing some scenes with a therapist, I learned a lot about what makes apologies hard, for them and for us."}]},{"section":"2","title":"Just say you’re sorry","slides":[{"text":"This is how many times each character said the word “sorry.” Some people say it freely, others not so much.","visual":"Viz - bar chart by character, colored within by effective / ineffective apologies?"},{"text":"The presence of “sorry” is a decent proxy of a good apology. If someone doesn’t want to say it, it feels like they’re sidestepping a true apology. There’s a lot present in the two words – taking ownership, showing remorse. Simple, but powerful."},{"text":"Let’s take a look at a moment from Jen, #X “sorry”-sayer. Here, Jen is attempting to apologize, but just can’t help adding some more after the “sorry.”","visual":"Clip - Jen apologizing at the hypnotist"},{"text":"“When the person giving the apology starts adding on all the add-on stuff, like “if you hadn't said that, then I would not have done this”, “but you did that first and so that's why I did this”... don't add all those, keep it very straightforward. Focus on your actions… take accountability for the role you played, even if it's 5% of what happened. And keep it very simple.” – Lazarus","visual":"Layer this on top of the previous beat. Video? Audio? Or just text?"},{"text":"It makes sense that “sorry” has been given this special weight. If you’re gonna know one thing about apologizing, “sorry” is a good place to start (just think of how we teach kids to say they’re sorry). But that can be taken too far. Sometimes “sorry” becomes a magic wand, a shortcut to accomplishing everything an apology needs without trying."},{"text":"Like here, where Britany decides she wants to “officially” apologize for saying several rude things about Bronwyn’s husband. She goes through the motions, but it doesn’t land.","visual":"Clip - Britani officially apologizing"},{"text":"Or here, where Lisa repeatedly shouts “I’m sorry for your loss!” at Whitney, which also doesn’t land.","visual":"Clip - Lisa apologizing to Whitney"},{"text":"So while a simple “sorry” can accomplish a lot, it doesn’t always line up with a good apology. And if you’re going to use it, don’t add a bunch of other things around it. Just stand in it. Which is hard to do!"}]},{"section":"3","title":"Don’t make it about you","slides":[{"text":"Why is it so hard for us to just stand in it? Let’s focus on Lisa Barlow, the character with the lowest rate of effective apologies [or whatever the exact stat is].","visual":"Lisa’s bar chart + Clip - “do i have a problem saying i’m sorry? never”"},{"text":"Here, Meredith says that she didn’t feel like Lisa was there for her when her father died.","visual":"Clip - Lisa denying it / over-apologizing"},{"text":"I think Lisa saying “I’m a horrible person”, this over-exaggerated apology, is actually a tell of what Lisa feels is at stake here.","visual":"Layer on top of clip"},{"text":"“What an apology kind of gets at is that it can create this sense of internal conflict within the person who's being asked to give the apology because it's really challenging who they believe they are, their reputation of themselves, who they think they're not, and what they're being presented to be.” – Lazarus","visual":"Layer on top of clip"},{"text":"For me, one of the core challenges of delivering a good apology is not to get stuck in a spiral where I feel like I’m a bad person. It’s as if that’s what’s at stake here, and not just the incorrect way I loaded the dishwasher or the tone with which I said XYZ. I’m most equipped to apologize well when I am grounded in a sense of my self-worth."},{"text":"This quote from Dr. Harriet Lerner, therapist and author of “Why Won’t You Apologize?” made me think of Lisa, and of my own experiences too.","visual":"“In order to apologize, a person needs to have a big, sturdy platform of self-worth to stand on… but some people stand on a small, rickety platform of self-worth. They can’t let themselves really see the hurt that they’ve caused because to do so would flip them or threaten to flip them into an identity of worthlessness and shame. The non-apologizer walks on a tightrope of defensiveness above a huge canyon of low self esteem.”"},{"text":"When apologies are about our identity and our goodness, it becomes much harder to apologize effectively. As opposed to this “shame spiral”, Lazarus wants people to think about moving towards a “self-worth spiral” – anchoring yourself in the knowledge that ultimately this is a positive thing that creates more growth and more connection."}]},{"section":"4","title":"It’s not over after the apology","slides":[{"text":"When I first started going through these apology moments, I figured a key piece of what would make for a good apology was that it seemed genuine and that the other person received it as genuine.","visual":"Screenshot of the spreadsheet, color coding the apologies / apology definitions"},{"text":"But Lazarus brought up a good point when we talked, that just because someone gets emotional or feels really sorry in the moment doesn’t mean real healing will necessarily happen."},{"text":"That might help explain this – here are Jen Shah’s apologies. Fans of the show might be surprised that she has the highest percentage of solid apologies and the most overall [or whatever the stats are].","visual":"Jen Shah’s bar chart"},{"text":"Jen actually does apologize a lot. And she does a good job. She owns it, she shows remorse, vows to do better. Like in this clip where she apologizes to Meredith and Seth about saying mean things about their marriage.","visual":"Clip - Jen apologizing at the reunion"},{"text":"Or here, where she apologizes for her behavior while also sharing context on her childhood that helps explain (but not excuse) her actions.","visual":"Clip - Jen apologizing at the luncheon"},{"text":"So, is Jen the queen of apologies and healthy, harmonious relationships?","visual":"Clip - “I need to write a goddamn book on how to apologize”"},{"text":"Not so much. The problem with many of Jen’s apologies is that after these moments, she turns around and does the same things again. [more here] So, are these effective apologies?","visual":"Something to demonstrate"},{"text":"There’s more to an apology than what is said in the moment. There’s also what happens after the apology.","visual":"“The apology is really two pieces. It's a statement piece and then it's the action piece.” – Lazarus"},{"text":"If the goal of an apology is to create healing, change on the other side needs to be demonstrated for it to hold up."},{"text":"This also explains why so many issues on the show recur again and again, ready to be brought up at any minute. The final step of actually facing the thing you apologized for, bettering yourself, and being different rarely occurs.","visual":"Clip - going around in circles, season 5"}]},{"section":"5","title":"Conclusion","slides":[{"text":"It can be infuriating to watch these ineffective apologies and constant conflict. As audience members, we feel like we can see where they went wrong, why the apologies aren’t working, thinking we would do better if we were in their shoes."},{"text":"But would we?"},{"text":"In regular life, we often withhold our grievances, and we are not nearly this confrontational. When’s the last time you demanded an apology from someone?"},{"text":"RHOSLC shows us what happens when you’re not allowed to stop hanging out with people you sort of hate – so you are forced to manage conflict! You’re encouraged to share your feelings, air your grievances, confront others, which all make for great TV. And frequent, if messy, apology attempts."},{"text":"By the end of this project, I had a totally different appreciation for the complexity of a good vs. bad apology."},{"text":"It’s easy to watch and think “I’m nothing like these women, and I’ll never get in situations like this.” It’s harder to take a look at the ways in which these women are addressing conflict more than we ever would, and even though they often do a bad job, it’s in a lot of the same ways that you or I would."},{"text":"I like this notion, because instead of running from, fearing, or being ashamed of apologies, it lets us step into them as positive, growth and connection opportunities. It’s a skill to be continually getting better at. And because we’re all flawed humans, good thing we’re all going to get a lot more practice.","visual":"“If you’re in healthy relationships with people, you’ll have to apologize and they’ll have to apologize to you.” – Lazarus"}]}]`),t={sections:e};export{t as c};
