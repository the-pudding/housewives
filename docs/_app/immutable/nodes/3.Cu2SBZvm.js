Focus on your actions… take accountability for the role you played, even if it's 5% of what happened.

The non-apologizer walks on a tightrope of defensiveness above a huge canyon of low self esteem.”"},{"text":"When apologies are about our identity, it becomes much harder to apologize effectively.
