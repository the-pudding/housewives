Focus on your actions… take accountability for the role you played, even if it's 5% of what happened. And keep it very simple.” – Lazarus"},{"text":"If there’s one thing people associate with apologizing, it’s saying “sorry” –  we teach our kids to say it, expect to hear it from others, and instinctively reach for it ourselves.

The non-apologizer walks on a tightrope of defensiveness above a huge canyon of low self esteem.”"},{"text":"When apologies are about our identity, it becomes much harder to apologize effectively.
