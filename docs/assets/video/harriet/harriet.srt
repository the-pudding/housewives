1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:05,466
In order to apologize a person needs to have a big

2
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:10,366
sturdy platform of self worth to stand on

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,566
but some people stand on a small

4
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:17,266
rickety platform of self worth

5
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,500
they can't let themselves really see

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,400
the hurt that they've caused

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,366
because to do so would flip them

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,766
or threaten to flip them

9
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:32,000
into an identity of worthlessness and shame

10
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:36,966
the non apologizer walks on a tight rope

11
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:38,700
of defensiveness

12
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:43,766
above a huge canyon of low self-esteem
