00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600 line:-3
I noticed the passive aggressive "apology" that happened

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.500 line:-3
I'm so sorry, I'm a horrible human being

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.566 line:-3
That's also what an apology kind of gets at

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.666 line:-3
is that it does create

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.500 line:-3
or can create

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.866 line:-3
this sense of internal conflict within the person

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.700 line:-3
who's being asked to give the apology

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.866 line:-3
cause it's really challenging who they believe they are

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.866 line:-3
their reputation of themselves

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.433 line:-3
who they think they're not

11
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.166 line:-3
and what they're being presented to be

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:26.166 line:-3
I'm a horrible human being
