I think it’s pretty common for both parties to think they deserve some sort of apology. Which can result in a standoff, no one wanting to apologize first. Because what’s the worst that could happen: you put yourself out there and apologize, and the other person just walks away and you don’t get what you need. So, a strategy: trade apologies!
