00:00.100 --> 00:01.466
within every attempt

00:01.466 --> 00:03.600
the person keeps stepping on their own toes

00:03.600 --> 00:05.000
they're like but they're like "but"

00:05.000 --> 00:06.366
they're like "I would never", "I could have said"

00:06.366 --> 00:08.066
"I should have just said this or said that"

00:08.066 --> 00:09.566
and it's like the person can say

00:09.566 --> 00:12.133
I apologize for saying what I said

00:12.133 --> 00:15.500
for doing what I did and I was wrong for that

00:15.500 --> 00:16.700
and I apologize for it

00:16.700 --> 00:19.966
a beautiful way that an apology can happen
