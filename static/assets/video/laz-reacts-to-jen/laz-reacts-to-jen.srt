1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,466
within every attempt

2
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,600
the person keeps stepping on their own toes

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,000
they're like but they're like "but"

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,366
they're like "I would never", "I could have said"

5
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,066
"I should have just said this or said that"

6
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,566
and it's like the person can say

7
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,133
I apologize for saying what I said

8
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,500
for doing what I did and I was wrong for that

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,700
and I apologize for it

10
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,966
a beautiful way that an apology can happen
