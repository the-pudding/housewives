1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,333
I'm sorry Meredith

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,833
I should have just made it
very black and white

3
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,000
when I was asked questions

4
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,133
I didn't go out and say that

5
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,066
I'm so sorry I'm so

6
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,000
so sorry so sorry

7
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:13,766
I'm truly

8
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,066
truly sorry but I feel like I'm being

9
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,500
the I'm sorry has to come with no condition

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,366
I'm sorry, I'm sorry Meredith

11
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:23,766
the last thing I would ever do
is hurt you

12
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,200
within every attempt

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,400
the person keeps stepping on their own toes

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,733
they're like but they're like

15
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:29,533
I would never

16
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,200
I could have said

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
I should have just said this or said that

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,333
and it's like the person can say

19
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,833
I apologize for saying what I said

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,333
for doing what I did and I

21
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,400
I was wrong for that and I apologize for it

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,766
a beautiful way that an apology can happen
